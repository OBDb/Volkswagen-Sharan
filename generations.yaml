generations:
  - name: "First Generation (Type 7M)"
    start_year: 1995

    description: "The first-generation Volkswagen Sharan was developed as a joint venture with Ford (which sold its version as the Galaxy), representing Volkswagen's entry into the European MPV (Multi-Purpose Vehicle) segment that was growing in popularity during the mid-1990s. Featuring conventional minivan styling with a tall, boxy profile maximizing interior space, the Sharan offered seating for up to seven passengers in a flexible interior configuration. Initially available with sliding rear doors on both sides—a practical feature unusual for European vans at the time—the Sharan provided easy access to all three rows of seating. Engine options varied throughout the long production run but typically included a range of four-cylinder and VR6 petrol units plus diesel options including both naturally aspirated and later TDI turbodiesel variants, with power outputs ranging from approximately 90 to 204 horsepower, paired with manual or automatic transmissions driving the front wheels. The interior emphasized versatility with various seating configurations, including removable second and third-row seats in early models, later replaced by a more user-friendly fold-flat system in the substantial 2000 facelift that also brought significantly revised exterior styling and improved equipment. A second major update in 2004 brought further styling revisions, enhanced safety features, and improved technology. Despite its age in later years, the first-generation Sharan maintained relevance through continuous updates and its fundamental practicality, serving as Volkswagen's primary family-focused vehicle in European markets for an unusually long 15-year production run, demonstrating the soundness of its original design and the ongoing demand for practical MPVs during this period."

  - name: "Second Generation (Type 7N)"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2022
    description: "The second-generation Volkswagen Sharan represented a complete redesign, now developed independently by Volkswagen rather than as a joint venture with Ford, based on the company's versatile PQ35/PQ46 platform shared with various other Volkswagen Group products. Featuring more modern, refined styling with clean lines and a sleeker overall appearance while maintaining the practical boxy profile necessary for maximum interior space, the new Sharan grew slightly in all dimensions to enhance passenger comfort and cargo capacity. The most significant design change was the adoption of rear sliding doors as standard on both sides, enhancing practicality for family users. Engine options included a range of TSI petrol and TDI diesel units with power outputs ranging from approximately 115 to 220 horsepower, paired with manual or DSG dual-clutch automatic transmissions driving the front wheels. The interior received a comprehensive redesign with significantly improved materials, design, and technology, while emphasizing versatility with Volkswagen's 'EasyFold' seating system allowing all five rear seats to be folded flat into the floor individually—creating up to 32 different seating configurations. Available in five, six, or seven-seat layouts depending on configuration, the Sharan offered exceptional flexibility for family or business use. Technology advanced significantly with features including adaptive cruise control, park assist, automatic emergency braking, and enhanced infotainment systems with connectivity options becoming available, particularly after a mid-cycle update in 2015 that also brought subtle styling revisions and improved efficiency. Despite the market's increasing shift toward SUVs and crossovers, the second-generation Sharan maintained appeal through its unmatched interior flexibility, car-like driving dynamics, and superior space efficiency compared to SUV alternatives, particularly in European markets where MPVs retained stronger popularity. Production ended in 2022 as part of Volkswagen's broader strategy to reduce traditional MPVs in favor of SUV-inspired vehicles, marking the end of the Sharan nameplate after 27 years."
