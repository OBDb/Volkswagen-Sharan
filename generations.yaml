generations:
  - name: "First Generation Mark 1/Phase 1 (Type 7M)"
    start_year: 1995
    end_year: 2000
    description: "The original Volkswagen Sharan was launched in August 1995 as a joint venture between Volkswagen and Ford to compete in the growing European MPV market. The name 'Sharan' was said to be derived from the Persian word 'Shahran' meaning 'Carrier of Kings', though Volkswagen describes it as a made-up word. Available with five engine choices: 1.8T (150 hp), 2.0 (115 hp), 2.8 VR6 (174-204 hp), and 1.9 TDI diesel variants (90-110 hp). The design was a compromise between Volkswagen and Ford styling, with front resembling Ford Mondeo Mk1 and rear like Volkswagen Passat B4. The 2.8 VR6 model offered optional Syncro all-wheel drive. Small visual changes in 1998 included door wings from Volkswagen Golf Mk4 and dashboard updates. The Sharan received a Euro NCAP three-star safety rating in 1999. Won several awards including Auto Express New Car Honours – Best MPV (1999)."

  - name: "First Generation Mark 1A/Phase 1.5 (Type 7M)"
    start_year: 2000
    end_year: 2004
    description: "The Sharan received a major facelift in May 2000. Volkswagen extended the wheelbase by 140mm, increased front and rear track, and gave it the 'Volkswagen family' look including a brand new dashboard no longer sourced from Ford. Seven seats came as standard. Engine lineup included updated 1.8T (150 hp), 2.0 (115 hp), 2.8 VR6 (204 hp), and 1.9 TDI diesel engines (100-130 hp). Some 1.9 TDI variants offered 4motion all-wheel drive with 6-speed manual transmission. Won Auto Express New Car Honours – Best MPV in 2000. The cooperation between Volkswagen and Ford ended in 2006, with Ford going alone to build the second generation Galaxy."

  - name: "First Generation Mark 1B/Phase 1.75 (Type 7M)"
    start_year: 2004
    end_year: 2010
    description: "A minor cosmetic facelift was implemented in September 2003 for model year 2004, primarily changing the grille and tail lights. More standard equipment was added including air conditioning and curtain side airbags. Ford introduced an independently developed new Galaxy in 2006, not based on Sharan/Alhambra designs. The first generation Sharan continued production until August 2010 at the AutoEuropa plant in Portugal. New engines included 2.0 TDI (136-140 hp). A BlueMotion variant was introduced in 2008 with lower CO2 emissions (159g/km). An LPG version launched in June 2006 with a flexible fuel engine working with petrol or autogas. Total production reached nearly 670,000 units across all first generation variants, making it one of the longest-running car models in Europe."

  - name: "Second Generation Pre-Facelift (Type 7N)"
    start_year: 2010
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The second-generation Volkswagen Sharan was launched at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show, based on the Volkswagen Passat B7 platform. Unlike its predecessor, this was developed independently by Volkswagen rather than as a joint venture with Ford. It grew longer (by 22mm), wider (by 92mm) and lower (by 22mm) with a wheelbase lengthened by 124mm. Weight was reduced by up to 75kg compared to the first generation. The most significant change was the adoption of sliding rear doors as standard on both sides. Initial engine range comprised 1.4-litre TSI (148 hp) and 2.0-litre TSI (197 hp) petrol options, plus two 2.0-litre TDI diesel engines rated at 115 and 140 hp. Paired with manual or DSG dual-clutch automatic transmissions driving the front wheels. The interior featured Volkswagen's 'EasyFold' seating system allowing all five rear seats to fold flat into the floor."

  - name: "Second Generation Facelift (Type 7N)"
    start_year: 2015
    end_year: 2022
    description: "A facelifted Sharan was unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show with new electronic systems and engines with reduced fuel consumption. The 2.0 litre TSI engine was upgraded to produce 217-220 hp and paired with the same six-speed direct-shift gearbox as the 2016 Golf GTI. The Sharan continued to be built at the AutoEuropa factory in Portugal, remaining popular for its unmatched interior flexibility and car-like driving dynamics. Production continued in Europe despite the market shift toward SUVs and crossovers. The Sharan was discontinued in the UK in 2021 but continued elsewhere in Europe until October 2022 when production finally ended after more than a decade of the second generation model. No direct replacement was planned as the market moved toward crossovers and SUVs like the Volkswagen Tiguan."
